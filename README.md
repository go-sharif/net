## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or later)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drippypale/go-sharif-net.git
   cd go-sharif-net
   ```

2. **Build the Application**

   ```bash
   go build -o go-sharif-net
   ```

3. **Move the Binary to Your PATH**

   ```bash
   sudo mv go-sharif-net /usr/local/bin/
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use package managers like `brew` or `apt` if supported in the future.

## Usage

`go-sharif-net` provides a simple CLI interface to manage your network authentication. Below are the available commands and examples of how to use them.

### Commands

- **login**
  - Authenticate to the network.
  
- **help**
  - Display help information about commands.
  
- **completion**
  - Generate shell autocompletion scripts.

### Global Flags

- `--config string`  
  Specify the configuration file (default is `$HOME/.go-sharif-net.yaml`).
  
- `--use-ip`  
  Use the IP address specified in the configuration instead of the domain.

### Login Command Flags

- `-u, --username string`  
  Username for login. **(Required)**
  
- `-p, --password string`  
  Password for login. **(Required)**
  
- `-a, --alive`  
  Keep the session alive to monitor and maintain the connection.

### Examples

1. **Login with Username and Password**

   ```bash
   go-sharif-net login -u your_username -p your_password
   ```

2. **Login and Keep the Session Alive**

   ```bash
   go-sharif-net login -u your_username -p your_password -a
   ```

3. **Use a Custom Configuration File**

   ```bash
   go-sharif-net login --config /path/to/config.yaml -u your_username -p your_password
   ```

4. **Generate Autocompletion Script for Bash**

   ```bash
   go-sharif-net completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/go-sharif-net
   ```

## Permissions and Running with `sudo`

Certain features of `go-sharif-net`, such as **Automatic Reconnection** and **Internet Connection Monitoring**, require elevated privileges to function correctly. This is because these features utilize ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) operations, which typically require root or administrative access.

### Why `sudo` is Necessary

- **ICMP Operations:** Monitoring the internet connection involves sending ICMP packets (ping) to check the connectivity status. Most operating systems restrict ICMP operations to users with root privileges to enhance security.
- **Automatic Reconnection:** To seamlessly reconnect to the network without manual intervention, the CLI needs to continuously monitor the connection status, which involves privileged network operations.

### How to Run `go-sharif-net` with `sudo`

To enable these advanced features, you should run the CLI with `sudo`. Below are examples of how to execute the `login` command with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo go-sharif-net login -u your_username -p your_password -a


## Configuration

`go-sharif-net` allows customization through a configuration file. By default, it looks for a file named `.go-sharif-net.yaml` in the home directory.

### Example Configuration (`~/.go-sharif-net.yaml`)

```yaml
username: your_username
password: your_password
use_ip: false
session_duration: 8h
```

**Note:** Storing passwords in plaintext configuration files can be a security risk. Consider using environment variables or secure storage mechanisms to handle sensitive information.

## Development

### Code Highlights

- **Cobra & Viper:** Utilizes Cobra for CLI commands and Viper for configuration management.
- **Session Management:** Handles session login and maintains it with optional monitoring.
- **Concurrency:** Implements goroutines and channels to manage asynchronous tasks like pinging and session checking.
